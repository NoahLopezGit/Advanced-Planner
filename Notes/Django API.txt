py manage.py shell - opens interactive python shell with added django API

----to create a question object in your database---
from polls.models import Choice, Question - imports model classes?
Question.objects.all()
from django.utils import timezone
q = Question(question_text="What's new?", pub_date=timezone.now())\
q.save()
q.id
q.question_text
q.pub_date

q.question_text = "What's up?"
q.save()

Question.objects.all()
Question.objects.first()

filters can be added to these queries:
Question.objects.filter(id=1)
Question.objects.filter(question_text__startswith='What')

Can also be retrieved directly like so:
q = Question.objects.get(pk=1)
Question.objects.all()[X]


c = Choice(question=a,choice_text="Choice 1")
    note how a choice is linked to a question here. the question object, a, is passed to the choice question field, which is used to link the choice to that question
